# Work-Day-Scheduler
This is homework 5, a work day scheduler. The scheduler shows a standard work day with the hours color coded for past, present, and future. When text is added to an hour and that hour is saved the text will persist in local storage and be loaded the next time the scheduler is opened.

An example can be found here: https://tober65.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/
